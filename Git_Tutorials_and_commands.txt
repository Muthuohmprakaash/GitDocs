GIT Commands

Install GIT from your browser.

1) Create a repository named GitDocs.
2) Open the command prompt and configure GIT using: git config --global user.name "Muthuohmprakaash" and press ENTER.
3) Next, type: git config --global user.email "omprakaash490@gmail.com" and press ENTER.
4) Type: git clone https://github.com/Muthuohmprakaash/GitDocs.git // This is the HTTPS link. After creating the repository on GitHub, it will be visible.
5) In your local system, there will be a hidden .git folder inside the repository folder. This folder links your local system to GitHub.
6) Use: git add .\Git_Tutorials_and_commands.txt to stage your changes.
7) Use: git commit -m "DOCS: Give your message" to commit the staged file.
8) For writing commit messages, visit: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
9) Use: git push origin main (where 'origin' is the remote and 'main' is the branch name; this can be 'main', 'master', or any other branch). This command pushes the staged files to the cloud repository.
10) Use: git reset to unstage files.
11) Use: git pull to update your local repository with changes made on GitHub.
12) Use: git status to check your current status in the staging area.
13) Use: git diff to see the differences between changes made before and after.
